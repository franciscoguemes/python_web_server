# Python Web Server

This is a Python UI ([Tkinter](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tkinter) based) app for starting the Python [http.server](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.server.html). 
You can start the server listening in any available port in your machine. The server will expose the directory you choose in your machine. 

This application is very handy to share files among multiple machines in the same network or to use it as web server to serve static pages during development. 

## Getting Started

To start with the project simple checkout the project:
```bash
$ git checkout https://github.com/franciscoguemes/python_web_server.git
```

Then enter in the directory _python_web_server_ and execute the file _pyserver.py_
```bash
$ ./pyserver.py
```

To see the UI mockup design open the file _python_web_server.epgz_ with tha applicaiton [Pencil](https://pencil.evolus.vn/)
